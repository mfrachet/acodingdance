This blog post is about strong and personal opinions that I have (and that might change in the future) about the way I like to build a product. Nothing here is a rule of thumb, just a dump of my brain at this specific moment.

## The list

### 100% of the time, I will pick React

Reasons

### react-query / apollo-graphql instead of a global state management system

Reasons

### Cypress is great but Playwright might take the lead

Reasons

### Having good (enough) UI primitives is mandatory

Reasons

### Accessibility is not a choice

Reasons

### Duplicating code is okay, and often time necessary

Reasons

### Focusing more on use-cases and the business and less on abstractions

Reasons

### TypeScript over JavaScript, every time it's possible

Reasons

### Testing components is as important as testing helpers

Reasons

### Components with a million props should be split

Reasons

### Compose business components with UI ones

Reasons

### Business components should only have business related props

Reasons

### Avoid central configurations

Reasons

### Server Side Rendering is not always necessary

Reasons

### A flatten project structure is way easier to understand

Reasons

### Avoid ./index.(js|ts) at a module's root

Reasons

### Avoid google-analytics and friends and prefer tools that respect privacy

Reasons

### E2E encryption should be a standard

Reasons

### Named export, always, everywhere, every time

Reasons

### Prefer hooks over HOCs and render props when possible

Reasons (being explicit)

### It's okay to use React Context a lot

Reasons
