Server Side Rendering (or SSR) is a really big trend. In the React ecosystem, we have plenty of tools that rely on this like [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/).

Before getting further about SSR, let's try to see what happens when a user makes a request on a site that is NOT using SSR:

- The browser makes a request on a specific URI
- It downloads an empty HTML file that only has a bunch of `<script>` tags inside to load some JS code
- It resolves / parses / compiles the JS code
- It executes the JS code and that's only then the application is ready and displays content to the user

This is how the good old [Angularjs](https://angularjs.org/) or [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) applications were working. And this is also what happens when we use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
We say that these applications rely on "Client Side Rendering" (or CSR).

#### Why SSR has been invented?

When building an application using CSR, we **always** have to wait for the JS code to be resolved / parsed / compiled / executed **before** having anything displayed on the screen.
And this can be problematic because:

- CSR apps are not optimized for SEO (SEO works, but it takes longer)
- We don't benefit from a good media sharing experience
- It can take time to boot a huge JS application in the browser

_I remember having worked on an Angularjs application in 2013 where it took around 7 seconds to display the first content on the page._

#### How does it solve these problems?

The main idea behind server side rendering is to generate HTML content and make it available the sooner to the end user.

This way, when a user makes a request:

- The browser makes a request on a specific URI
- It downloads **an already filled HTML file** and can already display it to the user
- Optionnally, an application can be started in the browser for interactivity reasons.
