At [JSConf Iceland 2018](https://2018.jsconf.is/), [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) has presented different new features such as Time Slicing, Suspense and an API that would allow to fetch some information using a synchronous API. ([link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLF0n9SACd4))

If you use to work with JavaScript on the client side, you probably know that `fetch` returns a `Promise` and thus is asynchronous. When you enter in an asynchronous "world", with a callback, timer or promise, you have to stand in that world:

```javascript
const getBulbasaur = () =>
  fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(({ name ) =>{
		// we only reach this part when the information is received
	})
```

## React cache API

The API that I've mentioned earlier is called `react-cache` and is actually experimental. We can use it inside a component like:

```jsx
// create an API resource from something asynchronous
const ApiResource = createResource(getBulbasaur)

const Component = () => {
  // make a synchronous call on the ApiResource and get the information
  const bulbasaur = ApiResource.read()

  return <div>Hello {bulbasaur.name}</div>
}
```

The first time I've see these few lives, I've been a bit confused. But here's a working [codesandbox sample fetching Bulbasaur](https://codesandbox.io/s/6y0jpl802k).

After digging a bit and trying to understand what's happening under the hood, I've (nope, [@swiip](https://twitter.com/swiip) and I have) finally found how it may work.

## React render is stateless

Since [fiber](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture), React computations have been divided in multiple phases:

An important thing to notice is that the render phase is stateless and thus has **no side effects**.

It's an important concept because we are now able to call it multiple times without directly affecting the DOM.

## Synchronous fetch

In this part, I will create a very little system that allows to build components using the same stateless approach to demonstrate how we may build and use such a synchronous API.

### Our own component definition

For the sake of simplicity, we'll rely on simple and standard concepts.

Let's say that we have a component defined by:

```javascript
import { createComponent } from './framework'
import { customFetch } from './custom-fetch'

const Pokemon = createComponent(({ id }) => {
  const pokemon = customFetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${id}/`)

  return html`
    <div><h1>${pokemon.name}</h1></div>
  `
})
```

Where `html` is defined:

```javascript
const html = (strings, ...interpolated) =>
  strings.reduce((content, currentString, index) => {
    const newValue = interpolated[index] || ''

    return content + currentString + newValue
  }, '')
```

### customFetch implementation

The idea behind this synchronous call is to abuse the render phase of React: we will do asynchronous operations **in between** of two render calls. An important thing to notice is that we will **interrupt** the render execution to handle the asynchronous function **somewhere else**.

To clear our mind, let's write down what we have to do to make that synchronous fetch:

- render the component and interrupt its rendering when the synchronous fetch is called
- fetch some data **somwhere else**
- re-render the component with the information fetched

The last point may be a bit obscure but we'll implement a system that answers this problem.

Let's build the `customFetch` function to only handle the interrupting responsibility without fetching anything:

```javascript
let cache

export const customFetch = url => {
  if (cache) {
    return cache
  }

  throw { type: 'FETCH', url }
}

// This will be called later to actually make the customFetch not throwing
export const setCache = data => {
  cache = data
}
```

When we will call the `customFetch` method, it will check for an internal `cache` to exist. If it doesn't exist, it will throw an error and **interrupt** the current function execution(aka our component render function).

Sometimes later, when another function will call the `setCache` method, the `cache` variable will be populated. And then when the `customFetch` method will be called a second time, it will not break and will return the cached value.

### Handling the "error"

We've implemented a system that allows to interrupt and resume a component render function. We now need to really fetch some remote data.

Let's imagine that `createComponent` is our way to define a custom components. It's a bit like the `extends React.Component` thing.

The idea is to manage the "error" thrown by the component during its `customFetch` call and to make a real world fetch:

```javascript
// using a simple root element
const root = document.getElementById('app')

export const createComponent = Component => props => {
  try {
    // This should throw the first time, but not the second time
    // because the customFetch cache is filled
    root.innerHTML = Component(props)
  } catch (action) {
    if (action.type === 'FETCH') {
      fetch(action.url)
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(res => {
          // This line allows to NOT throw on second render
          setCache(res)
          root.innerHTML = Component(props)
        })
    }
  }
}
```

The first thing we `try` to do is simply to render the component. If it throws, like in our case, we can trigger some specific computations based on the message we receive. If the message is a `FETCH` type, we concretely use a real world fetch and we re-render our component.

The way we're sending information somewhere to the top and waiting for a specific behavior is commonly called [Algebraic effects](https://www.eff-lang.org/handlers-tutorial.pdf). There's the effect: the `throw` statement, and there's the effect handler: the `catch` block in a parent.

## Run it for real

Here's a Codesandbox that shows how it work for real:
