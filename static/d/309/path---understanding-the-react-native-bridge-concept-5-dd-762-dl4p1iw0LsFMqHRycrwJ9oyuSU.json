Its main strength is that it doesn’t rely on <a href=\"https://www.telerik.com/platform-next-level\">webviews</a> like other competitors (<a href=\"https://phonegap.com/\">Phonegap</a>, <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/\">Ionic</a>, <a href=\"https://cordova.apache.org/\">Cordova</a>…, but on the actual real materials provided by the different platforms. It has built-in access to all the native views and components, and to about 70 specific device APIs by default (<a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios.html\">you can extend it</a>).</p>\n<p>When writing React Native apps, we build native UIs. And that’s the key point, we create UIView instances just like we would have with platform specific languages:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/xcode.png\" alt=\"RCTView implements UIView\"></p>\n<p>My first assumption on this framework was something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They probably create an AST from the JS code and transform it to make it run on multiple devices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That would make sense and that’s actually what <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cw7A4HbvM_Abv320rVgPVGiUP2msVs7tfGbkgdrTy0I/edit#slide=id.p\">Google/Flutter</a> does while building apps (with <a href=\"https://www.dartlang.org/\">Dartlang</a>). But that’s not the React Native way.</p>\n<p>The main problem with this approach is that targeting platforms for compilation based on JavaScript code would imply the creation of new compilers. I don’t know any existing tool accepting JavaScript as entry code that is able to produce code for every targeted platform (eventually see <a href=\"https://jasonette.com/\">Jasonette</a>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/compiler.png\" alt=\"NB: some have tried but only for mobile development with opinionated approaches\"></p>\n<p>But what currently exist are compilers that target their own specific platform. For example, we have compilers that accept Java / Kotlin code and target Android platform, or Obj-C / Swift targeting iOS platform. It exists many compilers for different languages and targets. They do their job well because <strong>they have been designed</strong> to create optimised artefacts for them.</p>\n<p>React Native is built in such a way that <strong>it uses existing compilers</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/cross-compiler.png\" alt=\"NB: some have tried but only for mobile development with opinionated approaches\"></p>\n<p>It’s built with a really opened architecture that allows the code to be run, not only on mobile devices, but also on other platforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kusti8/proton-native\">Desktop applications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-360/\">Virtual Reality</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16198843\">Many more</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It can also be used with other frameworks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alibaba/weex\">Weex</a>, a React Native port of Vuejs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/angular/react-native-renderer\">a custom Angular renderer that allows to run ng apps in devices, with React Native</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So how did the team build such a framework, that is platform and framework agnostic, by using the existing tools &#x26; compilers?</p>\n<h2 id=\"Multiple-realms-interacting-nothing-else\"><a href=\"#Multiple-realms-interacting-nothing-else\" aria-label=\"Multiple realms interacting nothing else permalink\" class=\"custom-class\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 576 512\"><path d=\"M12.971 352h32.394C67.172 454.735 181.944 512 288 512c106.229 0 220.853-57.38 242.635-160h32.394c10.691 0 16.045-12.926 8.485-20.485l-67.029-67.029c-4.686-4.686-12.284-4.686-16.971 0l-67.029 67.029c-7.56 7.56-2.206 20.485 8.485 20.485h35.146c-20.29 54.317-84.963 86.588-144.117 94.015V256h52c6.627 0 12-5.373 12-12v-40c0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12h-52v-5.47c37.281-13.178 63.995-48.725 64-90.518C384.005 43.772 341.605.738 289.37.01 235.723-.739 192 42.525 192 96c0 41.798 26.716 77.35 64 90.53V192h-52c-6.627 0-12 5.373-12 12v40c0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12h52v190.015c-58.936-7.399-123.82-39.679-144.117-94.015h35.146c10.691 0 16.045-12.926 8.485-20.485l-67.029-67.029c-4.686-4.686-12.284-4.686-16.971 0L4.485 331.515C-3.074 339.074 2.28 352 12.971 352zM288 64c17.645 0 32 14.355 32 32s-14.355 32-32 32-32-14.355-32-32 14.355-32 32-32z\"/><script xmlns=\"\"/></svg></a>Multiple realms interacting, nothing else</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a step back and look at the big picture of React Native.</p>\n<p>React Native deals with two realms, the JavaScript one and the Native one.
