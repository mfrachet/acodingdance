Building reusable UI components is really hard. I'm always banging my head around three times before writing a component that I want to be reusable. It's kind of a game to find the good abstraction and the good way to build such a thing.

In [A note on composing components with React](https://acodingdance.io/a-note-on-composing-components-with-react/), I've briefly talked about my conception of composition, feel free to talk a look if you're interested ☺️.

Today, I wanted to talk about building UI components. I'm actually implementing a UI component library based on a design system and I wanted to share with you my point on _more complex_ components.

## My experience

* components are business oriented
* often non consistent between pages
* a lot of page duplication 
* APIs moves a lot because of lack of composability
