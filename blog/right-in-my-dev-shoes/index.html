          <h1>Right in my dev shoes</h1>

          <p>Working in the web industry is like a gift and a curse to me. On one side, I'm increasing my situation and making money doing something that I love and on the other side, I'm seeing an increasing amount of things that I don't agree with but that becomes quite the norm — and it feels bad to be part of that without doing anything.</p>
<h2>Why am I feeling that way?</h2>
<p>Earning money when running a business is, hopefully, normal and evident. Earning more money every year is a sign of good health for a company. Problems arise when, to make money, <strong>people cross the ethical frontiers</strong>.</p>
<p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of questions that raises ethical problems to me and that I would like to share with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many companies gather personal information about people to compute them and make money from them?</li>
<li>How many of those companies are considered examples for younger developers?</li>
<li>How many women are less paid than their men peers?</li>
<li>How many people don't have valid experience on the web because of inaccessible content?</li>
<li>How much energy do we spend running all those services in the cloud?</li>
</ul>
<p>Every single question in this list deserves an entire book to get proper answers.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this post is not about blaming people that are not aware of the problems. <strong>It aims to make them realize that these things are not okay per se</strong> and that they should be addressed.</p>
<h2>How to fix that?</h2>
<p>The answer is simple on the paper, but very hard in practice: <strong>we have to care</strong>. It's not about just knowing and putting the problems somewhere in our heads and &quot;remembering to tackle them later&quot;. <strong>We have to be aware and act concretely</strong>.</p>
<h3>Choosing tools and services that respect people's privacy</h3>
<p>For instance, if we need to get audience information about our websites, what about using <strong>tools that respect people's privacy</strong>? <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible.io</a> is one of them and it allows to get that information without the need for private data (there are others, it's just the one that I use, I don't have any bindings with the company).</p>
<p>On the consumer side, if you don't agree with some companies' policies (<a href="https://wicg.github.io/floc/">you may have heard of some kind of new tracking technics recently</a>), <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">Privacy Tools</a> is a great website giving practical advice, suggesting services and tools to reduce your privacy exposure.</p>
<p>We're not forced to use (or to be the victims of) tools from mastodons that keep track of <strong>users' moves, through our websites, making us at least, partially responsible.</strong></p>
<h3>Equity</h3>
<p>The second point is about gender equity — and I should say equity in general.</p>
<p>If by any means, we spot a salary discrepancy between two people doing the same job, discrimination, or even harassment, <strong>we have to bring the problem up</strong>. We're not forced to react intensely, we can gently raise the flag and create a discussion. <strong>But it's important to raise that flag</strong>. We have to communicate, try to understand and find a way the fix the problem.</p>
<p><strong>We should not hesitate to be vocal and to support our colleagues</strong> when they need us, let's offer them our help, and manifest ourselves to improve the situation. Multiple voices have more impact than a single one from a person that faces professional difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Hiding and keeping information because we don't feel concerned (or not comfortable) is selfish and unethical. It contributes somehow to keeping this problem real but also hidden.</strong></p>
<h3>Embracing Accessibility</h3>
<p>The third point is about accessibility. I can't say how grateful I am to have been introduced to it by <a href="https://twitter.com/amber1ey">Amberley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/madalynrose">Madalyn</a>.</p>
<p>One amazing effect of accessibility is that when you learn enough of it, you immediately become an advocate and can't do without it. Accessibility is an ethical topic where <strong>everybody</strong> should be provided with a frictionless user experience when using a service or a tool — and it does not only apply to people that can <em>see</em> what's happening on a screen.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with accessibility, to me, is that <strong>the number of people who have already built a truly accessible website is very low</strong>. I don't blame anyone for not having this knowledge, I have personally never heard of it in school nor during my first 6 years working in the industry. But it's important to be aware of it, to educate ourselves, and to learn more about it.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with accessibility, I suggest reading <a href="https://dev.to/hichamelbsi/accessibility-is-a-priority-3jbf">Accessibility is a priority</a> published by one of my colleagues that provides practical wins to make your website more accessible. Also, I highly recommend spending time on <a href="https://a11y.coffee/">A11y Coffee</a> to completely dive into the topic.</p>
<p><strong>We have to keep in mind that making our websites more accessible is a game-changer for more people than we think, we and our companies included. Not making this is, to me, as serious as discriminating a whole population</strong>.</p>
<h3>Ecology, green IT</h3>
<p>The last point of my bullet list is about energy consumption.</p>
<p>It's a very tough topic since our job is to build things running on electrical devices and so, our creations consume a certain amount of energy, often time 24/7. <strong>We live in an era of over-consumption and as technical people, we love innovation. The thing is, sometimes, innovation creates more indirect or invisible problems than it solves</strong>.</p>
<p>We obviously have to change the way we consume, reducing wasting, <strong>making sure our electronic devices (that are built using a gigantic amount of natural resources) reach their lifespan</strong> before getting new ones.</p>
<p>Concerning our web creations, two things can be done to reduce their footprints: <strong>hosting them on a &quot;Green Hosting&quot; provider that has a low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_usage_effectiveness">PUE</a></strong> and <strong>using the right tools for the right job</strong>. What would be the real advantages of building a blog with a server-side technology on a whole Kubernetes cluster to only serve a few posts?</p>
<p>Also, if you come from the React ecosystem, I've written a post about <a href="https://mfrachet.github.io/blog/choosing-a-rendering-strategy/">the different rendering strategies I would adopt depending on the circumstances</a> that help me <strong>avoiding server-side rendering when I don't need it</strong>. And for French people, <a href="https://www.greenit.fr">Green It</a> proposes workshops and books about improving website footprints at the code level.</p>
<p>On the auditing side, I've recently discovered two tools to measure, or at least to provide an order of growth, of the energy consumed by a website: <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">WebsiteCarbon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marmelab/argos">Argos</a>. I don't have that much feedback on them but the intent deserves at least respect and encouragement.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think">The internet accounts for around 4% of the greenhouse gas emissions which is the same amount as the whole airline industry.</a></strong></p>
<h3>Educating, teaching, learning</h3>
<p>I voluntarily skipped the second point in the list and it's, for me, probably the most important.</p>
<p>Younger developers may dream of fame and be part of an elite, wanting to join big companies because &quot;they are the place to be&quot;. There is nothing wrong with that but there are some correlations between some topics addressed in this post and some companies that people are dreaming to join.</p>
<p>To make sure we don't commit to the same errors as we did in the past such as encouraging innovation in potentially ethically discussable directions, I think it's our role, as more senior developers, mentors, and older adults <strong>to sensitize youngers and to educate them to reduce this kind of problems in the future, making them &quot;exceptions&quot; and not the norm</strong>.</p>
<p>And hopefully, we should educate ourselves, too, because, you know, it's not the fault of the others.</p>
