This is my first post on my new ~~fake~~ blog! How exciting!

I'm Marvin Frachet, a french software developer currently moving to Canada. I'm mainly focusing on frontend problems and really
like to work with React and React Native ecosystem. I'm building "software" since I'm 13 years old. At that time, my pleasure was
to create game character description using HTML/CSS for https://slayersonline.net/ and little programs with C/C++ in the console.

Over the years, I've earned multiple skills and oriented myself in what I really like: **building applications that I can see and interact with**.
This is the way I've travelled all around the JavaScript world, trying to build as user compliant application as I can and trying to become a better developer / person every days.

I've decided to write this little blog to improve my english level and to share my passion with you. I love to understand how things are working and try to get big pictures of how a system could be built. This blog also aims to gather information I've in mind and to share them with you.

I hope it would help!
